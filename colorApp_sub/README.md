Color app using LBS on Android\
\
This sample app uses a basic publish/subscribe paradigm to broadcast a color around his position. Then the subscriber triggers a match whenever there is a publication in his range with the same topic.\
\
The app has been written using Kotlin just for test purposes to present how LBPS works.}
